# Stratum Guide for Administrators

As an Administrator ("Admin"), you are responsible for the day-to-day management of your organization's Stratum workspace. You have broad permissions to manage users, content, and the organizational structure.

## 1. The Admin Dashboard

Your landing page after logging in is the Admin Dashboard. This provides you with at-a-glance analytics on:
*   Course completion rates.
*   User engagement and activity.
*   Recent forum discussions.

## 2. Managing Users

You can access the User Management section from the main navigation menu. Here, you can:

*   **Invite New Users:** Click "Invite User" and enter their email address. They will receive an invitation to join your organization's workspace.
*   **Assign Roles:** When a user accepts their invitation, you can assign them a role (e.g., "Manager," "Employee"). You can change a user's role at any time.
*   **Deactivate Users:** If an employee leaves the organization, you can deactivate their account. This preserves their historical data but revokes their access to the platform.

## 3. The Org Anatomy Engine

This is one of Stratum's most powerful features. It allows you to visually build and manage your company's hierarchy.

*   **Accessing the Engine:** Navigate to "Organization" > "Hierarchy".
*   **Creating Departments:** Create new departments or teams.
*   **Building the Chart:** Use the drag-and-drop interface to arrange departments and establish reporting lines (e.g., place the "Marketing" and "Sales" departments under the "Revenue" division).
*   **Assigning Members:** Assign users to their respective departments. This is crucial as it determines their access to role-specific content and forum channels.

## 4. Content Creation

You have the authority to create and manage the core knowledge and training materials for your organization.

*   **Document Management:**
    *   Navigate to the "Documents" section.
    *   Upload company documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.). These documents will be automatically processed by our AI and become searchable via the employee chat interface.

*   **Lesson & Quiz Builder:**
    *   Navigate to the "Content" section.
    *   Create new training modules and lessons using our intuitive editor.
    *   Build quizzes to test understanding and knowledge retention. You can create multiple-choice questions, true/false, and more.
    *   Assign lessons and quizzes to specific departments or roles.

## 5. Forum Management

You can create and moderate forum channels to facilitate communication. For example, you can create a "Company-Wide Announcements" channel and a private "Leadership Team" channel.

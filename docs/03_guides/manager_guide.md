# Stratum Guide for Managers

As a Manager, you have a specific set of permissions designed to help you lead your team effectively within the Stratum platform. Your focus is on your team's development and communication.

## 1. The Manager Dashboard

Your dashboard provides a focused view of your team's progress and activity. You will see:
*   Training completion status for your direct reports.
*   Quiz scores and performance of your team members.
*   Recent activity in your department's private forum channel.

## 2. Managing Your Team

*   **Viewing Progress:** You can view detailed analytics for each member of your team, identifying who has completed required training and who may need additional support.
*   **Assigning Content:** Depending on your organization's settings, you may have permission to assign specific lessons or quizzes to your team members from the company's content library.

*(Note: You do not have permission to invite new users to the organization or change their global roles. This is an Admin responsibility.)*

## 3. Departmental Forums

*   **Moderation:** You are a moderator of your department's private forum channel. You can guide discussions, answer questions, and ensure conversations remain productive.
*   **Participation:** You can participate in company-wide forums as well as any other channels you have been given access to.

## 4. Using the Knowledge Tools

Like all employees, you have access to the full suite of knowledge tools:
*   **AI Chat:** Use the AI-powered chat to get quick, context-aware answers to your questions based on company documents.
*   **Taking Courses:** You can be assigned training to complete, just like any other employee.

*Your role is a bridge between the administration and the employees. Use these tools to foster growth and communication within your team.*

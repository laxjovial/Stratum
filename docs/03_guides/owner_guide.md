# Stratum Guide for the Organization Owner

Welcome to Stratum! As the Organization Owner, you have the highest level of permissions and are responsible for the initial setup and overall management of your organization's account.

## 1. Initial Account Setup

The first time you log in, you will be guided through the "First Run" setup process. This involves:

1.  **Creating Your Organization:** You will be prompted to enter your organization's name. This creates your unique and isolated workspace within Stratum.
2.  **Setting Up Your Subscription:** You will be directed to our secure billing portal (powered by Stripe) to select a subscription plan and enter payment details.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

Your primary responsibilities as the Owner include:

*   **Billing and Subscription Management:** You are the only user who can access the billing portal to change subscription plans, update payment methods, or cancel the account.
*   **Appointing Administrators:** While you have all administrative rights, it is recommended to delegate day-to-day management to one or more "Admins." You can assign the Admin role to any user from the User Management dashboard.
*   **Top-Level Settings:** You can configure organization-wide settings that may not be accessible to Admins.
*   **Account Deletion:** Only the Owner can initiate the process to permanently delete the organization's account and all associated data.

## 3. Accessing the Billing Portal

You can manage your subscription at any time by:
1.  Clicking on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
2.  Selecting "Billing" from the dropdown menu.
3.  This will redirect you to a secure portal where you can view invoices, change your plan, and update your payment information.

## 4. Transferring Ownership

If you need to transfer ownership of the organization's account to another user, please contact Stratum support for assistance. This is a security measure to protect your account.

# Stratum Guide for Employees

Welcome to Stratum! This platform has been designed to help you find the information you need and to support your professional growth within the company. This guide will walk you through the key features available to you.

## 1. Your Dashboard

When you log in, your dashboard will show you:
*   **Assigned Training:** A clear list of any lessons or quizzes that have been assigned to you by your manager or an administrator.
*   **Your Progress:** A summary of the training you have completed.
*   **Recent Announcements:** The latest posts from company-wide forums.

## 2. Taking Lessons and Quizzes

*   **Accessing Training:** You can access your assigned training directly from your dashboard or by navigating to the "My Learning" section.
*   **Progressing Through Content:** Work through lessons at your own pace. Your progress is saved automatically.
*   **Completing Quizzes:** After a lesson, you may be prompted to take a quiz to test your knowledge. Your scores will be recorded and visible to your manager.

## 3. The AI-Powered Chat: Your Smart Assistant

This is your most powerful tool for finding information quickly.

*   **How to Use It:** Simply open the chat window and ask a question in plain language, just like you would ask a colleague.
    *   *Example: "What is our policy on work-from-home days?"*
    *   *Example: "How do I set up my development environment?"*
*   **How It Works:** The AI has read all of the official company documents and will provide you with an answer based on that information. Because the system knows your role and department, it will give you the most relevant answer for you.

## 4. Participating in Forums

*   **Joining Discussions:** Navigate to the "Forums" section to see the discussion channels you have access to. This will include company-wide channels and a private channel for your department.
*   **Sharing Knowledge:** You can ask questions, share insights, and collaborate with your colleagues in the forums.

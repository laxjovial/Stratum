# Stratum: Investor Brief

## 1. The Company
**Stratum** is a B2B SaaS platform building the next generation of corporate knowledge management systems. We are creating a "living knowledge base" that is intelligent, adaptive, and deeply integrated into the structure of an organization.

## 2. The Problem
Companies today are drowning in information, yet employees can't find the answers they need. Traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) are static, and knowledge bases are often outdated and difficult to search. This leads to decreased productivity, inefficient onboarding, and knowledge silos.

## 3. The Solution
Stratum solves this by fusing a powerful content and training platform with a context-aware AI search engine. Our core innovation is the **Org Anatomy Engine**, which allows companies to map their unique organizational structure. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI then uses this context to provide employees with answers that are relevant to their specific role, department, and seniority.

Instead of a static manual, Stratum becomes a dynamic, conversational knowledge source that learns and grows with the company.

## 4. Key Differentiators
*   **Context-Aware AI:** Our RAG model understands who is asking the question and provides tailored, accurate answers.
*   **Dynamic Org Hierarchy:** Our visual drag-and-drop hierarchy builder is intuitive and powerful, making our system adaptable to any company structure.
*   **Unified Platform:** We combine training (LMS), document management, and collaborative forums into a single, cohesive experience.

## 5. Market Opportunity
The corporate e-learning and knowledge management market is a multi-billion dollar industry ripe for disruption. We are targeting mid-to-large enterprises that feel the pain of knowledge silos and inefficient training. Our initial focus will be on tech companies, where rapid scaling and complex internal structures make our solution particularly valuable.

## 6. The Product (MVP)
The Minimum Viable Product will include:
*   **Org & User Management:** Multi-tenant organization support with Firebase authentication.
*   **Org Anatomy Engine:** Visual hierarchy builder.
*   **Content Engine:** Intuitive lesson and quiz builder.
*   **RAG Pipeline:** Secure document upload (PDF, DOCX) to a Pinecone vector database, with search powered by OpenAI embeddings.
*   **Social & Analytics:** Role-based forums and an admin analytics dashboard.

## 7. The Ask
We are seeking seed funding to finalize MVP development, onboard our first beta customers, and build out our initial sales and marketing team.

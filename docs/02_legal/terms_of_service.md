# Terms of Service for Stratum

**Last Updated:** [Date]

Welcome to Stratum! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Stratum platform and services (collectively, the "Service"), provided by [Your Company Name Inc.] ("we," "us," or "our").

By creating an account, or by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms.

## 1. The Service

Stratum provides a multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform for knowledge management, employee training, and internal communication. The Service includes the Org Anatomy Engine, a content creation suite, and an AI-powered search functionality.

## 2. Accounts and Responsibilities

*   **Account Creation:** You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account. The initial user from an organization is the "Owner" and has full administrative privileges.
*   **Your Responsibilities:** You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your organization's account, including the activity of your "Admin," "Manager," and "Employee" users. You are also responsible for safeguarding any credentials used to access the Service.

## 3. User-Generated Content

This section specifically addresses the content you and your users upload to the Service.

*   **Ownership:** You retain all ownership rights to the documents, lesson plans, quiz questions, and any other content you upload to the Service ("User Content"). We do not claim any ownership over your User Content.
*   **License to Us:** By uploading User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, display, and distribute your User Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service for you. This license is limited and allows us to, for example, store your documents, display them to your authorized users, and process them as described below.
*   **Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it. You represent that you have all necessary rights to your User Content and that it does not violate any laws or third-party rights.

## 4. AI-Powered Services and Data Handling

This section details how we handle your data in relation to our AI features (e.g., the RAG pipeline).

*   **Purpose-Bound Processing:** We will process your User Content with third-party AI models (e.g., OpenAI) for the sole purpose of providing the Service's features. This includes generating embeddings (numerical representations) of your documents and using those embeddings to provide context-aware search results for your authorized users.
*   **No Training on Your Data:** Your User Content will **not** be used to train or improve any third-party AI models. We have agreements with our AI sub-processors that prohibit them from using your data for their own purposes or for training their general models.
*   **Data Confidentiality:** All User Content processed by AI services is treated as confidential information.

## 5. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

Stratum is a multi-tenant platform. We have implemented strict logical controls to ensure the security and isolation of each organization's data.

*   **Logical Separation:** Your organization's User Content, user data, and configuration are logically separated from all other organizations' data.
*   **Access Controls:** Our application enforces strict access controls to prevent any user from one organization from accessing the data of another.

## 6. Subscription and Payment
[This section will be fully developed upon integration with Stripe. It will cover subscription terms, fees, billing cycles, and cancellation policies.]

## 7. Termination
You can stop using our Service at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service with notice to you if you are in breach of these Terms.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Service is provided "as is." We disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages arising out of or relating to your access to or use of the Service.

## 10. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 11. Changes to Terms
We may modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide you with notice through the Service or by other means. Your continued use of the Service after the changes have been implemented constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
